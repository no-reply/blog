> Sets of triples are called RDF graphs: intuitively, each triple can be viewed as an edge from
> node s to node o with label p. Here, s, o, and p are constant symbols – uniform resource
> identifiers (URIs) or literals (e.g., strings) – or anonymous identifiers, called blank nodes.
> Consider, for example, the graphs \\( S = \\{ ho, rdf:type, Ai,hA, rdfs:subClassOf, Bi \\} \\) and
> \\( E = \\{ ho, rdf:type, Bi \\} \\). Hayes (2004) defines notions of RDF and RDFS entailment.

Following is the complete syntax definition  \\( sin(x^2) \\) for all elements kramdown supports. Together with the documentation on the available converters, it is clearly specified what you will get when a kramdown document is converted.
