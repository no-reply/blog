About
-----

This is a blog about Knowledege Organization, Information Systems, and Software Development.

I'm a librarian and programmer; I work on data models and pipelines at the [Digital Public Library of America](http://dp.la), am an [RDF.rb](http://ruby-rdf.github.io) core team member, and an incoming Ph.D. student at the [University of Washington iSchool](http://ischool.uw.edu) in Fall 2016. I'm active in the Open Access and digital repositories space through Project Hydra, where I maintain [ActiveTriples](http://github.com/ActiveTriples/ActiveTriples), serve on the Technical Advisory Committee and Data Modeling subteam for [Hydra in a Box](http://hydrainabox.projecthydra.org/), and work on [other](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/derby) [nonsense](http://azaroth42.github.io/rdflib-ytriples/docs/).

My code is (mostly) in the public domain at [GitHub](https://github.com/no-reply).
