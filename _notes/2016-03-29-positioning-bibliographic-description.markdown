{: .epigraph}

This passage points to an important skill, not only for theorists, but for
practitioners; not only in a hypothetical future, but today. It positions
cataloguing and metadata work as the challenge of solving _description_ at
the appropriate level of abstraction.
{: #positioning-ch}

To do this, cataloguers must be aware of systems and their features; but, more
fundamentally, of languages of description and their capabilities & of the
features of particular models within them. How do we achieve this awareness for
professionals entering the field, as well as for those with significant
experience with a particular descriptive paradigm?
